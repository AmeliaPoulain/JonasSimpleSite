        <h3>Scottish Folds</h3>

        <div class="maincattext">
        <p>After his ears, the first thing you will notice about a Scottish Fold is his habit of posing in odd positions—flat out on the floor like a little frog, sitting up—for all the world as if he were a meerkat on a nature program—or lying on his back, paws up in the air. And although you might assume that his ears are less mobile than those of other cats, such is not the case. He uses them to communicate quite effectively, adding comments in a quiet, chirpy voice when necessary.</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Persians</h3>

        <div class="maincattext">
        <p>The Persian’s sweet, gentle face turns up to gaze at his favorite people the way a pansy turns its face to the sun. He communicates with his expressive eyes and his soft, melodious voice. The Persian is the epitome of a lap cat, with a restful and undemanding personality. He loves to cuddle, but he’s also playful and curious. He’s not a jumper or climber, instead posing beautifully on a chair or sofa or playing with a favorite feather toy. Persians prefer a serene, predictable environment, but they can be adaptable enough to weather a loud, boisterous family as long as their needs are understood and met.</p>
